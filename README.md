# Random Bash.org quotes

Returns random quotes from the now defunct [Bash.org] as archived over at
[dwrodri/bash_irc_quotes]. The dataset is a few years old so many quotes are
missing but it does capture the golden era of the website.

I have obviously not read all of the ~21k quotes so if there's something
particularly questionable, feel free to open an issue here and I will remove it.
